# Ride-Hailing Data Analysis

This repository contains insights and recommendations based on ride-hailing data, focusing on ride demand, operational efficiency, customer behavior, and revenue generation.

## 1. Ride Demand and Booking Patterns

**Findings:**
- **Total annual bookings:** 150,000 rides.
- **Monthly demand:** Stable, averaging 13,000 rides/month; minor month-on-month fluctuations.
- **Vehicle type preference:** Autos and Go Mini are most booked, especially at top locations like Jasola and Panchsheel Park.
- **Peak times:** Hourly spikes observed; demand concentrated in certain time slots and locations.

**Actionable Insights:**
- Demand is concentrated in specific vehicle types (Auto, Go Mini) and pickup locations.
- Regular, predictable peaks in demand can be leveraged for dynamic resource allocation.

**Recommendations:**
- Shift more supply (drivers) to high-demand zones during peak hours using geo-targeted prompts and incentives.
- Promote underutilized vehicle types in low-supply/low-demand corridors with discounted fares or ride vouchers.

## 2. Ride Completion, Cancellations, and Drop-offs

**Findings:**
- **Completion rate:** 62% of bookings completed; 38% cancelled or incomplete.
- **Top cancellation reasons:** No driver found, customer-related issues, vehicle breakdown, wrong address, change of plan.
- **Lost revenue:** Incomplete rides translate to significant revenue loss (millions in potential earnings).
- **Average incomplete ride characteristics:** 10.55 km and 20 minutes per ride.

**Actionable Insights:**
- “No driver found” is the largest controllable cause of incomplete rides, indicating supply-side gaps.
- Customer and system-related cancellations highlight opportunities to improve communication, app UI, and customer experience.

**Recommendations:**
- Refine matching algorithms for faster driver assignment during peak demand.
- Conduct periodic fleet maintenance to minimize breakdowns.
- Implement proactive app notifications to alert customers and drivers if rides are at risk of delay or cancellation.
- Educate drivers and riders on providing accurate addresses and reducing unnecessary cancellations.

## 3. Operational Efficiency Metrics

**Findings:**
- **Average Turnaround Time (VTAT):** Quickest for completed rides, slowest for cancellations/incomplete rides.
- **Average ride duration:** 30.03 minutes for completed rides; incomplete rides are shorter.
- **Driver reach time:** Consistently 8–10 minutes, a key factor in user experience.

**Actionable Insights:**
- Cancellations increase fleet idle time, reducing productive rides per driver per day.
- Opportunities exist to optimize driver routes, minimize idle times, and maximize utilization.

**Recommendations:**
- Use predictive analytics for driver shift planning based on demand and cancellation history.
- Launch “on-trip support” features to assist drivers with live issues.
- Incentivize completion of longer, higher-value trips to boost average booking value and operational returns.

## 4. Customer Behavior and Revenue

**Findings:**
- **Repeat customers:** High-value segment contributing disproportionately to revenue.
- **Payment preferences:** Cash, UPI, and Uber Wallet are leading methods, indicating partial digital adoption.
- **Ratings:** Customer (4.40/5) and driver (4.23/5) ratings are generally positive, with room for improvement.

**Actionable Insights:**
- Loyalty among repeat/high-value customers is crucial for sustainable growth.
- Some customers still face friction in digital payments.

**Recommendations:**
- Launch loyalty/reward programs targeting repeat/high-value customers.
- Optimize in-app payment UX and drive wallet/UPI adoption with cashback or partner offers.
- Tailor communication and promotions to retain high-repeat customers.
